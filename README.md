ExpandableListView With kotlin

I need to create a expandable list view in one of my office project.I know simple expandable list view. Which work like you can click different
List items and it will exapand. The problem with this approach was my previously opened item was not closed when I click on new Item.

So My mission was :P(Mission LOL)
When User click on a item in list it should expand and show its content and when user click on other item in the list the previously opened list item
should get close.

And this is the code how I Completed this mission.
